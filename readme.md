Exist Sense is a javascript driven web application that helps you make sense of your [Exist.io](https://exist.io/) custom tags and data.

This project is in alpha stages, it may or may not work as well as you'd like. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to use the [Issues](https://github.com/exist-sense/exist-sense.github.io/issues) page.

**UPDATE**: Exist has just announced their [roadmap for 2020](http://blog.hellocode.co/post/exist-in-2020/) which will include better tracking of custom values! Once more information becomes available, I will look at updating Exist Sense to properly support the new format.
